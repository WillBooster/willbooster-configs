## Snapshots

After each command, playwright-cli provides a snapshot of the current browser state.

```bash
> bunx @playwright/cli@latest goto https://example.com
### Page
- Page URL: https://example.com/
- Page Title: Example Domain
### Snapshot
[Snapshot](.playwright-cli/page-2026-02-14T19-22-42-679Z.yml)
```

You can also take a snapshot on demand using `bunx @playwright/cli@latest snapshot` command.

If `--filename` is not provided, a new snapshot file is created with a timestamp. Default to automatic file naming, use `--filename=` when artifact is a part of the workflow result.

## Browser Sessions

```bash
# create new browser session named "mysession" with persistent profile
bunx @playwright/cli@latest -s=mysession open example.com --persistent
# same with manually specified profile directory (use when requested explicitly)
bunx @playwright/cli@latest -s=mysession open example.com --profile=/path/to/profile
bunx @playwright/cli@latest -s=mysession click e6
bunx @playwright/cli@latest -s=mysession close  # stop a named browser
bunx @playwright/cli@latest -s=mysession delete-data  # delete user data for persistent session

bunx @playwright/cli@latest list
# Close all browsers
bunx @playwright/cli@latest close-all
# Forcefully kill all browser processes
bunx @playwright/cli@latest kill-all
